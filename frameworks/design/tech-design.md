### About Tech Design Progression Framework 

The Tech Design team progression framework was build not only to guide the team forward but also to inspire those who seek more responsabilities to achieve higher levels of understanding and commitment to what we do.

As the perspective and objetives of the team changes through time, the framework will be updated to follow this vision up close.
