### About our engineering progression framework
Our Engineering progression framework is a perpetual work-in-progress, and will never be "done". We're continuously learning and adapting it to suit the development needs of our engineers.

The purpose of the framework is to guide conversations around performance and progression between managers and engineers at Sthorm. It articulates the expectations of each broad level, the level of impact we expect engineers to bring to business problems, and the manner in which engineers should be conducting their work. This document is not designed to be useful as a standalone tool. *This is a compass, not a GPS.*

The framework shouldn't be used as a checkbox exercise, and it doesn't intend to codify every possible situation. Instead it lays out expectations in broad strokes that encourages conversations between engineers and their manager.


### Guiding pillars for engineering progression
When iterating on our progression framework, we've tried to keep the below guiding pillars in mind:
- We focus on the impact an individual engineer has on driving Sthorm forwards, rather than specific behaviours.
- Scope is an additional measure for different levels of seniority. As Sthorm grows, so should the size or reach of the problems we encounter as engineers.
- This framework shouldn't be seen as an exhaustive list of everything an engineer does or can do, but instead articulate the important distinctions between levels.
- Behaviours should be broad enough to factor in the numerous different ways an engineer can contribute effectively. As an example: we should not list specific tasks such as ‚Äúwrites complex RPC handlers‚Äù but instead articulate the standards of technical contribution we should expect from engineers of different levels. As a result, our framework will need more interpretation, and is likely to be ineffective when used independently without your manager. We do not wish to create an exercise that can be ‚Äúcheckboxed‚Äù to completion.

Levels in the framework are cumulative. Particularly within the technical skill and behaviours categories, we expect engineers to be demonstrating the contents of previous levels in addition to their own level. As an example: We expect level 3 engineers to also be proactively testing their work, despite this being a level 2 behaviour.


### Impact
Impact is the main driver for progression at Sthorm. Put simply, impact measures your sphere of influence and individual input on our success as a business, through contributing to Sthorm‚Äôs mission and goals. The area of the business you work in may mean you can have impact in different ways - for instance through contributing to growth, helping with efficiency or cost reduction, meeting regulatory requirements, or more. You may also have impact in other indirect ways, for example improving engineering practices, or helping others to grow.

Focusing on impact enables us to reward engineers who ‚Äúget stuff done‚Äù without them needing to perform specific routines. We believe impact results from the combination of building technical skill, having the opportunity to demonstrate it, learning from that experience over time, and coupling it with important behaviours and core skills.

Excellence here looks like:
The work you choose to do drives team, discipline and business goals forward (relevant to the scope of your role).
You proactively identify opportunities to further goals within engineering, and bring clarity to opportunities in order to prioritise them.
You ‚Äúget things done‚Äù. You work for the team, and are regarded as a highly effective contributor by your peers.


### Technical Skills
This aspect is about how you apply your technical skills and hone your craft, and documents the type of behaviours that measure the effectiveness of an engineer‚Äôs technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity. Think of this as ‚Äúhow you do your work‚Äù.

Our previous iteration was called ‚ÄúMastery‚Äù, and focussed on discrete behaviours. We found this led to engineers ‚Äúcheckboxing‚Äù their progression, and was often overly specific to certain areas of the business. Behaviours in this area should not detract engineers from doing what is most impactful for their team and Sthorm. Instead, this iteration focuses on measuring technical contribution via quality, testability, performance and ability to design and critique designs. Your technical skills will gradually scale and improve with experience.

Excellence here looks like:
Your code and technical contribution is regarded as high quality by your peers and those above you in the framework.
You can efficiently design systems to solve business problems, and can resolve ambiguity, both at the technical and product level.
Your systems are designed with the appropriate level of complexity for the problem at hand. Your software is as simple as possible, but no simpler.
Your work is resilient, well tested and scales to meet customer growth expectations

### Behaviours
Behaviours are a collection of expectations and development areas for engineers, that do not fall into the categories of technical skill and impact. They encompass a range of core skills that we expect engineers at Sthorm to embody.

Through your behaviour you set an example to those around you. By modelling great behaviours you lead by example, and by being self-aware you know when you are setting a great example. Your behaviours show that you‚Äôre growing good habits, and cultivating qualities that make an excellent engineer, rather than unintentionally doing the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù by luck.


### Extra levels

Staff Software Engineer (L7 | Manager II equivalent | 10+ years experience)
- The leadership increasingly becomes the primary criteria by which performance is judged. Many, though by no means all, SWEs begin managing a team of engineers by this point in their career. When hiring externally, ten or more years of experience are generally expected.
- Is typically a manager of a team of ten to twenty, sometimes a mixture of direct reports and managing other managers. When hiring externally, 10+ years of experience is expected.

Senior Staff Software Engineer (L8 | Senior Manager | Manager III | ProductLead)
- It is essentially L7 with larger expectations. Guidance for years of experience begins to break down at this level, as most candidates with ten or more years experience will be hired at Level 7 unless there is a strong reason to offer a higher level. Involvement of the hiring manager or strong pushback by the candidate can sometimes push the offer to Level 8.
- Begins the transition to be primarily a manager of managers. Teams are larger than L7, typically twenty to forty.

Principal Engineer (L9 | Director)
- It is the first level which is considered an executive of the corporation for the purposes of remuneration and corporate governance. Principal Software Engineers drive technical strategy in relatively large product areas. SWEs at level 9 or above are relatively rare: the equivalent level on the manager ladder will routinely have five or more times as many people as on the SWE ladder. By this level of seniority, most people are focussed on management and leadership.
- Directors are mostly managers of managers, and typically lead organizations of forty up to several hundred people.

Distinguished Engineer (L10 | Senior Director)
- Drives technical strategy in efforts spanning a large technical area.
- is basically a secret level: all of the internal tools will show only "Director," and by tradition promotions to Senior Director are not publicly announced. Senior Directors may lead slightly larger organizations than L9 Directors, though mostly it provides a way to have a larger gap between Director and VP while still allowing career progression.

Fellow (L11 | Vice President)
- It is the same level as a Vice President, expected to drive technical strategy and investment in crucial areas.
- typically leads organizations of hundreds to thousands of people. Their direct reports will typically be Directors and will be second to third level managers themselves.

Senior Fellow (L12 | Senior Vice President)
- Only mythological guys
- like Senior Director, is shown only as "VP" in internal tools and provides a way to maintain a larger gap between VP and SVP while still allowing managers to advance in their careers.
