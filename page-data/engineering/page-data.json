We've continued iterating on our progression framework since it was originally launched in 2017, and we're continuously learning and adapting it to suit the development needs of our engineers. This latest version sees us move away from multiple frameworks split across engineering disciplines. We decided instead to focus on the practice of engineering itself, and as such, it should not matter which programming language you choose to use.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the framework is to guide conversations around performance and progression between managers and engineers at Sthorm. It articulates the expectations of each broad level, the level of impact we expect engineers to bring to business problems, and the manner in which engineers should be conducting their work. This document is not designed to be useful as a standalone tool. <em>This is a compass, not a GPS.</em></p>\n<p>The framework shouldn't be used as a checkbox exercise, and it doesn't intend to codify every possible situation. Instead it lays out expectations in broad strokes that encourages conversations between engineers and their manager.</p>\n<h3>Guiding pillars for engineering progression</h3>\n<p>When iterating on our progression framework, we've tried to keep the below guiding pillars in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We focus on the impact an individual engineer has on driving Sthorm forwards, rather than specific behaviours.</li>\n<li>Scope is an additional measure for different levels of seniority. As Sthorm grows, so should the size or reach of the problems we encounter as engineers.</li>\n<li>This framework shouldn't be seen as an exhaustive list of everything an engineer does or can do, but instead articulate the important distinctions between levels.</li>\n<li>Behaviours should be broad enough to factor in the numerous different ways an engineer can contribute effectively. As an example: we should not list specific tasks such as “writes complex RPC handlers” but instead articulate the standards of technical contribution we should expect from engineers of different levels. As a result, our framework will need more interpretation, and is likely to be ineffective when used independently without your manager. We do not wish to create an exercise that can be “checkboxed” to completion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Levels in the framework are cumulative. Particularly within the technical skill and behaviours categories, we expect engineers to be demonstrating the contents of previous levels in addition to their own level. As an example: We expect level 3 engineers to also be proactively testing their work, despite this being a level 2 behaviour.</p>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<p>Impact is the main driver for progression at Sthorm. Put simply, impact measures your sphere of influence and individual input on our success as a business, through contributing to Sthorm’s mission and goals. The area of the business you work in may mean you can have impact in different ways - for instance through contributing to growth, helping with efficiency or cost reduction, meeting regulatory requirements, or more. You may also have impact in other indirect ways, for example improving engineering practices, or helping others to grow.</p>\n<p>Focusing on impact enables us to reward engineers who “get stuff done” without them needing to perform specific routines. We believe impact results from the combination of building technical skill, having the opportunity to demonstrate it, learning from that experience over time, and coupling it with important behaviours and core skills.\nExcellence here looks like\nThe work you choose to do drives team, discipline and business goals forward (relevant to the scope of your role).\nYou proactively identify opportunities to further goals within engineering, and bring clarity to opportunities in order to prioritise them.\nYou “get things done”. You work for the team, and are regarded as a highly effective contributor by your peers.</p>\n<h3>Technical Skills</h3>\n<p>This aspect is about how you apply your technical skills and hone your craft, and documents the type of behaviours that measure the effectiveness of an engineer’s technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity. Think of this as “how you do your work”.</p>\n<p>Our previous iteration was called “Mastery”, and focussed on discrete behaviours. We found this led to engineers “checkboxing” their progression, and was often overly specific to certain areas of the business. Behaviours in this area should not detract engineers from doing what is most impactful for their team and Sthorm. Instead, this iteration focuses on measuring technical contribution via quality, testability, performance and ability to design and critique designs. Your technical skills will gradually scale and improve with experience.</p>\n<p>Excellence here looks like\nYour code and technical contribution is regarded as high quality by your peers and those above you in the framework.\nYou can efficiently design systems to solve business problems, and can resolve ambiguity, both at the technical and product level.\nYour systems are designed with the appropriate level of complexity for the problem at hand. Your software is as simple as possible, but no simpler.\nYour work is resilient, well tested and scales to meet customer growth expectations</p>\n<h3>Behaviours</h3>\n<p>Behaviours are a collection of expectations and development areas for engineers, that do not fall into the categories of technical skill and impact. They encompass a range of core skills that we expect engineers at Sthorm to embody.</p>\n<p>In the previous iteration of our framework these were further broken down into influence, communication and leadership, however in this iteration we’re bringing them together.</p>\n<p>Through your behaviour you set an example to those around you. By modelling great behaviours you lead by example, and by being self-aware you know when you are setting a great example. Your behaviours show that you’re growing good habits, and cultivating qualities that make an excellent engineer, rather than unintentionally doing the “right thing” by luck.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/engineering","title":"🛠️ Engineering Framework","sidebarTitle":"🛠️ Engineering","sidebarGroup":"Technology","yaml":true,"levels":6,"homepage":true,"topics":[{"name":"Impact","title":"💥 Impact","content":[{"level":1,"criteria":["Writes well tested code and documentation in-line with our engineering principles","Demonstrates understanding of common Software Engineering concepts","Works to develop their usage of tooling and systems, including their development environment, source control, and internal Sthorm tooling"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":2,"criteria":["Delivers tasks and designs effective solutions to product features or small scope engineering challenges in their area of the business","Makes steps towards independently owning the development of a feature, or problem space, including the ability to identify, define, and scope problems","Breaks down medium sized engineering problems in collaboration with more senior engineers","Demonstrates ownership of smaller problem spaces, and repeatedly achieving successful outcomes for those problems"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":3,"criteria":["Helping the squad deliver work through owning, implementing and delivering medium sized features or projects within a squad","Helping the squad deliver work through confidently breaking down small to medium sized engineering problems, and leading other engineers to solve them","Onboarding or mentoring of engineers in their team well leads to an overall higher performing set of people","Relied upon to be a trusted problem solver, capable of leading the resolution of critical bugs or incidents related to their work or area of expertise","Enthusiastically engages with squad, Collective, or discipline-level initiatives where they’re best placed to help, bringing about positive change from their involvement"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":4,"criteria":["Contributes to their team or domain meeting goals through successfully leading and consistently delivering on projects of highly ambiguous scope, high complexity and critical business impact","Can be deployed to highest priority business problems or fires, can quickly resolve them and help the business understand how to avoid them in future","Proactively contributes to the betterment of other engineers in the company, through sponsoring, mentoring and providing constructive, candid feedback","Proactively gives technical and strategic feedback on projects relevant to their expertise that leads to better outcomes","Impacts the trajectory of the company both through working on the most impactful problems and being able to bring about change with effective momentum","Links technical contribution back to business impact for their team or area, and helps others to buy into this"],"exampleCriteria":null},{"level":5,"criteria":["Meaningfully contributes to achieving company and collective goals and directly increases the company’s value over time","Sought out by others for contribution on our most pressing and highest priority business challenges because they’re known to be effective","Leads large, strategic, complex engineering projects -
